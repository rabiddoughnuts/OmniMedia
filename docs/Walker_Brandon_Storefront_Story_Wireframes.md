# Website Story

## 1. Client Profile

OmniMedia Solutions is a new digital startup that aims to simplify how users track and discover entertainment across different mediums. Their mission is to unify fragmented tracking experiences — from anime and manga to TV shows, movies, and books — into one intelligent, customizable platform.

Currently, users rely on multiple niche websites or apps to log what they watch or read, each with its own limitations. OmniMedia Solutions wants to provide a single, intuitive solution that caters to both casual consumers and dedicated enthusiasts. The client’s goal is to launch a sleek, data-driven web platform that allows users to manage, organize, and explore their entire media universe in one place.

## 2. Purpose & Goals

The primary purpose of the website is to allow users to track and manage their engagement with all forms of media — books, manga, comics, anime, shows, and movies — in a single integrated space. Beyond being a database, it will serve as an interactive media companion that helps users make informed choices about what to watch or read next and where to access the media.

Success for OmniMediaTrak means users can efficiently add, view, and filter media entries without switching between platforms. The site’s spreadsheet-style interface supports deep customization: users can choose which fields to display (e.g., producer, episode count, release year, or tags) and filter by any parameter. A smooth, organized interface and strong database search capabilities will support the client’s goal of simplifying users’ media management habits.

### Core Goals

- Provide users with a unified, customizable interface for viewing and tracking all their media interests.

- Ensure data accuracy and consistency through automated backend aggregation.

- Offer powerful filtering, tagging, and search tools for managing media collections.

- Maintain a user-friendly yet information-dense layout that minimizes redundant navigation.

The long-term goal is to evolve OmniMediaTrak into a go-to hub for personalized media analytics — not just storage, but insight.

## 3. Target Audience

OmniMediaTrak’s target audience includes media enthusiasts aged 16–40 who consume entertainment across multiple formats. These users are often tech-savvy, organized, and motivated by efficiency. They value quick access to accurate information, dislike visual clutter, and appreciate customization.

To appeal to them, the website’s tone will be clean and informative yet friendly, with minimal ads and clear typography. The layout will prioritize legibility and control, evoking the structure of a database while remaining visually engaging. The color scheme will center on a deep purple accent complemented by neutral tones for readability.

**Needs & Motivations:** They are driven by the desire for organization and dislike redundancy. Many are frustrated by the need to visit multiple platforms just to track different media types or compare information like episode count, release year, or run time. They want a single “source of truth” that makes it easy to view, filter, and analyze their data without excessive clicking or page navigation. Many are power-users of spreadsheets and databases, and OmniMediaTrak’s structured layout appeals directly to this mindset.

**Habits:** These users often consume several forms of media simultaneously — watching a show while reading a manga or book series — and are methodical about logging their progress. They typically use multiple tabs or sites to stay organized, but are actively seeking a streamlined solution that saves time and improves visibility across all their collections.

**Tone & Layout Appeal:** The website’s tone will be clean and informative yet friendly, with minimal ads and clear typography. The layout will prioritize legibility, scanability, and control, rather than large imagery, allowing users to compare information at a glance without visual clutter or unnecessary navigation. It will evoke the structure of a database while remaining visually engaging and approachable. A darker color scheme with bright purple accents offers comfort for long viewing sessions, while clean, geometric typography reinforces a modern, technical feel.

## 4. User Story / Journey

OmniMediaTrak’s user journey emphasizes efficiency, clarity, and flexibility — ensuring that users can access and manage all their media information from a single dashboard. The process minimizes unnecessary clicks and provides data transparency across every step.

### The "What Should I Start Next" Journey

1. A returning user, Alex, logs into the site and lands directly on their Lists Dashboard, where all tracked media categories (Books, Manga, Anime, Shows, and Movies) are displayed in a unified, spreadsheet-like view.

2. Alex selects their “Unstarted Media” list, which contains titles across all media types, each displayed with key data fields such as Genre, Year, Producer, and Reviewer Rating.

3. Feeling like starting a short series, Alex uses the Filter tool to narrow results to only show items where Media Type = Anime and Number of Episodes = 20–26.

4. The list updates instantly to display the refined results. Alex then applies the Sort feature to organize the filtered list by Reviewer Rating (Highest → Lowest).

5. With the top-rated short-run anime now clearly presented side-by-side in OmniMediaTrak’s structured spreadsheet layout — complete with Synopsis, Producer, and Content-Rating columns — Alex can easily compare data without leaving the page.

6. After reviewing the options, Alex clicks on one title to open its Dedicated Media Page, where more details are displayed, including a brief synopsis, tags, and a “Where to Watch” link pulled from the integrated database.

7. Satisfied with the choice, Alex updates the State field for that title to Started, instantly reflecting their progress across the system.

- **New User Onboarding:** New users arrive at the homepage, read a short introduction explaining OmniMediaTrak’s purpose, and are prompted to sign up or browse media without an account. Upon registration, they’re guided through creating their first list or importing favorites from other platforms.
  
- **Search & Discovery:** Users can search across all media types simultaneously. When a title is found, its details populate automatically.

- **Dashboard Management:** Logged-in users organize lists by type or custom tag, and use filters to compare entries by metrics such as rating, release year, or completion status. Lists can be sorted dynamically, making it easy to view trends or identify new items to start next.

This journey emphasizes efficiency and fluid interaction. Every feature supports decision-making at a glance — without switching contexts or opening unnecessary pages.

## 5. Visual & Design Direction

The design will intentionally apply Gestalt principles of proximity and alignment to group related data cleanly within the spreadsheet-like interface, ensuring easy scanning and comparison across titles. Accessibility will be prioritized with sufficient contrast, scalable text, and full keyboard navigation for inclusivity.

- **Theme:** Modern minimalism meets structured data visualization

- **Tone:** Organized, tech-forward, creative

- **Imagery:** Minimalist with subtle gradients, faint grid textures, avoid distracting large cover art and graphics

- **Lighting:** Balanced contrast — light mode feels airy and efficient; dark mode feels cinematic and immersive

- **Key Accents:** Sleek lines, table/grid layouts, modular cards

- **Color Temperature:** Cool neutrals + vivid purple

The visual design will balance clarity, modernity, and depth. OmniTrack’s palette will revolve around purple as a unifying accent.
