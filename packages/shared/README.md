# Shared Schemas

## Project Description

Shared TypeScript/Zod schemas and types used by both API and Web packages.

## API Route List

This package does not expose HTTP routes directly.

Routes that consume these shared definitions are documented in:

- `../api/README.md`
- `../../README.md`

## Setup Instructions

From `packages/shared/`:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Environment Variable Requirements

No package-specific environment variables are required for building shared schemas.

## Build

```
npm run build
```
